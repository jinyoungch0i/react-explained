# react-notes

This is my attempt to consolidate my understanding of key topics in React. 

At best, it is an 'unofficial' documentation and, at worst, it serves as a repository whereby I think out loud on things that I want to remember and thoroughly process in order to build my foundation in React.js. 

Select list of topics will be reviewed and documented in their respective markdown documents. The list currently consists of:

- [Fragments](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Fragments.md)
- [Default Props](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/DefaultProps.md)
- [State](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/State.md)
- [Context](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Context.md)

On instances where code snippets serve to better illustrate respective concepts, certain topics have been initialised in their own repositories and were deployed on Github Pages. Those topics are:

- [Functional Components](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-functional-components)
- [Controlled Forms](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-controlled-forms)
- [Higher Order Components](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-hoc)

I would love to receive any feedback/criticism in the likely scenario that I am flawed in my understanding of some (if not all) of these topics. :)
