# react-notes

This is my attempt to consolidate my understanding of key topics in React. 

At best, it is an 'unofficial' documentation and, at worst, it serves as a repository whereby I think out loud on things that I want to remember and thoroughly process in order to build my foundation in ReactJS. 

Select list of topics will be reviewed and documented in their respective markdown documents. The list currently consists of:

- [Fragments](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Fragments.md)
- [Default Props](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/DefaultProps.md)
- [State](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/State.md)
- [Context](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Context.md)

I would love to receive any feedback/criticism in the likely scenario that I am flawed in my understanding of some (if not all) of these topics. :)
