# react-notes

This is my attempt to consolidate my understanding of key topics in React. 

At best, it is an 'unofficial' documentation and, at worst, it serves as a repository whereby I think out loud on things that I want to remember and thoroughly process in order to build my foundation in ReactJS. 

Select number of topics will be reviewed and documented in their respective markdown documents (e.g. Fragments.md).

I have decided to open source, since I would love to receive any feedback/criticism in the likely scenario that I am mistaken in my understanding of some (if not all) of these topics.
