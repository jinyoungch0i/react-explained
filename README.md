# react-explained

This is my attempt to consolidate my understanding of key topics in React. 

At best, it is an 'unofficial' documentation and, at worst, it serves as a repository whereby I think out loud on things that I want to remember and thoroughly process in order to build my foundation in React.js. 

Select list of topics have been reviewed and documented in the below markdown documents.

The list currently consists of:

- [Fragments](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Fragments.md)
- [Default Props](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/DefaultProps.md)
- [State](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/State.md)
- [Context](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-notes/blob/master/Context.md)

On instances where code snippets and demos serve to better illustrate concepts, the following topics have been initialised in their own repositories and were deployed on Github Pages.

Those topics are:

- [Functional Components](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-functional-components)
- [Controlled Forms](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-controlled-forms)
- [Higher Order Components](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-hoc)
- [Context API](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-context)
- [Hooks - useState()](https://github.com/jinyoungch0i/react-hooks-useState)

Contributions and feedback are very welcome. Please fork this repository or [email](mailto:jinyoungsjourney@gmail.com) me.
